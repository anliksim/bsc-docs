# Cloud Native Applications

Benefits:
- Improve time-to-market (on-demand, self-service)
- Optimize cost (pay-as-you-go)

Drawbacks:
- Exposure to failures (built on commodity-hardware)
- Performance issues (shared infrastructure)

Lifecycle:
- Design
- Implementation
- Deployment
- Provisioning
- Operation & Runtime Management
- Disposal

Characteristics:
- Optimized for running on cloud
- Distributed application


Methodologies:
- Architecture: Scalability, resilience
- Organization: Agile teams with DevOps principles
- Process: Automation
- SOA/Microservices
- CNA Principles/Patterns

- Stateless 
- Discoverable


## Microservices

- Suite of small services
- Running in it's own process
- Lightweight
- Built around business capabilities
- Independently deployable
- Minimal centralized
