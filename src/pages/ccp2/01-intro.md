# Cloud Computing 2

TCO = CAPEX + OPEX

## PaaS

Deploy applications onto cloud infrastructure using programming languages, libraries, services and tools supported by the provider.
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure.

Example
- Google App Engine
- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
- Heroku
- CloudFoundry

### Motivation

- Focus on business functionality, development
- Faster value to market
- On demand cost model
- Standardized environments

### Differences

Hosting: 
- dedicated resources
- no cloud computing

IaaS+:
- deployed on VMs
- tenant manages scaling, patching, etc.

PaaS:
- fully managed by provider
- cloud characteristics: self-service, resource optimization, HA, disaster recovery, security

### Domain specific PaaS

PaaS for vertical markets, offers domain-specific services

Examples
- PaaS for IoT
- PaaS for Robotics
- PaaS for Health Care
