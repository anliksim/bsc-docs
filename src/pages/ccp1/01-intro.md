# Cloud Computing

## CAPEX

Capital Expenses (CAPEX) is money spent to buy fixed assets. It cannot be deducted in the year of spending and has to be capitalized (e.g. hardware)


## OPEX

Operational Expenses (OPEX) are the sum of all day-to-day, ongoing expenses for operations (e.g. license fees, maintenance, etc).


## TCO 

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) = CAPEX + OPEX


## Considerations

ICT capacity consumption models:
- Stable capacity
- Scheduled increase in capacity
- Scheduled increase in capacity
- Periodic bursting
- Predictable bursting
- On and Off - Inactive periods


Usually we see the model of periodic bursting which makes it hard to plan for optimal capacity / cost.


Planned capacity vs actual use:
- too much capacity => waste
- too little capacity => customer dissatisfaction



## Principles

- On-demand self-service: A consumer can provision computing capabilities automatically and without human interaction
- Broad network access: Accessibility over the network and through standard protocols
- Resource pooling (multi-tenancy): Resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers and the consumer has no control or knowledge of the exact location of the provided resource
- Rapid elasticity: Resources can be elastically provisioned and released i.e. scaled out an in
- Measured service (pay-as-you-go): Resources are automatically controlled and optimized and usage can be monitored, controlled and reported transparently


## Service Models

End Users:
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Applications running on cloud infrastructure by providers and for consumers to access

Application Developers:
- Function as a Service (FaaS): Server-less computing - provided code is run and charged for by a cloud operator
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Deploy applications onto cloud infrastructure without having to manage it

Network Architects:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provisioning of processing, storage, networks and other computing resources without having to manage the underlying cloud infrastructure/physical hardware


## Deployment Models

- Private cloud: Provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization
- Community cloud: Provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers with shared concerns
- Public cloud: Provisioned for open use by the general public
- Hybrid cloud: Composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures, bound together to enable storage and compute portability
