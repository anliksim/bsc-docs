# Introduction

## History

* Predicate logic (GottlÃ¶b Frege) => Logic programming
* Turing machines (Alan Turing) => Imperative programming
* Lambda calculus (Alonzo Church) => Functional programmingg
* Recursive functions & automata (Stephen Kleene) => Regex, FSM


**Binary notation**: First programs, everything had to be determined by hand and programmer had to keep track of where everything was stored.

**Assembly language**: Next level with reusable macros and subroutines. Programs had to be rewritten for every hardware platform.

**Fortran**: First hihg-level language. Variables and equations instead of registers and addresses.

**C**: Portable assembler
